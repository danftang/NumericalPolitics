## Numerical politics

Numerical politics is a completely new approach to the study of politics in which we perform numerical experiments on simulated societies in order to gain an understanding of organised behaviour among autonomous individuals. This repo is intended to provide the software necessary to allow anyone to set up a numerical "laboratory" and start studying simulated societies. In these pages we'll describe how to perform numerical experiements and discuss how the practice of numerical politics can contribute to our understanding of how to effectively govern real-world societies.
