Numerical politics is a completely new approach to the study of politics in which we perform numerical experiments on simulated societies in order to gain an understanding of organised behaviour among autonomous individuals. This repo is intended to provide the software necessary to allow anyone to set up a numerical "laboratory" and start studying simulated societies. In these pages we'll describe how to perform numerical experiements and discuss how the practice of numerical politics can contribute to our understanding of how to effectively govern real-world societies.

Suppose we have a number of interacting agents whose behaviour is described as a probability distribution $$P(a\|O,\psi)$$ that an agent in state $$\psi$$, that has made observations $$O$$ of its environment and surrounding agents, will perform  action $$a$$, and a measure of individual wellbeing $$W(\psi)$$ based on the state of each agent. Define collective wellbeing as $$\sum_\psi W(\psi)$$, the sum of the wellbeing measures of all agents. The focus of numerical politics is to make predictive statements about collective wellbeing in terms of the properties of the behaviour of the agents.
