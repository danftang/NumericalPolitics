Let V be a vector of integers. Each element position represents a possible state of an agent and the integer at that position represents the number of agents in that state. We'll call this an occupation vector. We define a transition rate, R, so that R(V'|V)dt is the probability that a vector V will transition to state V' in time dt, so we have a Markov model over all possible occupation vectors.

We assume that each possible transition in the Markov model is either a single agent responding to its own state or an interaction between two agents so that we can define the behaviour of an agent as

Given this, we can consider probability distributions over the occupation vectors, and the transition rates defines a rate of change of a probability distribution, so we translate to a dynamic system whose state space is the probability distributions over the set of all occupation vectors. [is it true that all attractors are point attractors in this space? Does it matter?]


Now assume we have occupation matrices. The row gives the "interaction state" and the column gives the "agent type". Only agents in the same interaction state can interact.
