Our aim is to take what we know about, on the one hand, human behaviour and on the other, existing social norms and social history and use the fact that the latter emerged from the former to make assertions about what we don't immediately know. In particular, constraining human behaviour and states of the world. Testing existing hypotheses about human behaviour and about social norms.

In particular, what is the smallest set of assumptions about human behaiour that leads to the emergence of certain social norms (or, indeed, any kind of social norm)?
