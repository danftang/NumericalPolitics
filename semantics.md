## Model semantics

Given a model, which consists of a policy $$\pi$$, an agent wellbeing $$W$$ and a probability distribution over states,
[should we have universal probabilistic agents with policy also absorbed into state? We can then work entirely in a Fock space, and consider the dynamic system within this phase space.]

### The power of ideas: The politics of information

If it is the case that the agents are bounded rational, then **understanding** becomes an intervention. By making some subset of agents aware of some information this would change their behaviour, which would change the dynamics of the system.
